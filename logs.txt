ChatCompletionMessage(content="In the realm of code, where logic weaves,\nLies a concept that many believe.\nRecursion it's called, a nested delight,\nAn algorithmic dance that takes flight.\n\nImagine a function, bold and true,\nWith the power to call itself anew.\nA loop within a loop, like mirrors reflecting,\nA path of execution, endlessly connecting.\n\nWith each invocation, it splits in twain,\nA problem divided, smaller domains.\nInto the abyss it bravely descends,\nTill a base case appears, a journey's end.\n\nAnd when that case is finally met,\nA return is made, no need to fret.\nUpward it rises, in a graceful sweep,\nBringing solutions from the depths so deep.\n\nLike a fractal within the coding sphere,\nRecursion's elegance will surely endear.\nIt conquers problems, both great and small,\nDecomposes complexities with a humble call.\n\nBut take heed, O coder, as you tread,\nRecursion's path, where bugs may spread.\nFor infinite loops can haunt the unwary,\nIn a tangled web of memory weary.\n\nSo, contemplate this recursive tale,\nOf functions that on themselves set sail.\nFor in the land of code's poetic symmetry,\nRecursion grants us endless possibility.", role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None)
